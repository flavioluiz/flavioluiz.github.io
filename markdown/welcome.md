# Welcome!

I am FlÃ¡vio Cardoso-Ribeiro, an Associate Professor in the Flight Dynamics Department at [ITA](http://www.ita.br) (Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de AeronÃ¡utica) in SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos, Brazil. 

## Research Focus
My research combines theoretical and applied approaches in:
- Aeroelasticity and Flight Dynamics of Flexible Aircraft
- Port-Hamiltonian Systems
- Fluid-Structure Interactions
- Control Systems

Currently, I coordinate the FINEP/EMBRAER project "Advanced Studies in Flight Physics and Control" (2022-Present), where we develop advanced methodologies for aircraft modeling and control.

## Recent Highlights
- Development of structure-preserving numerical methods for fluid-structure interaction
- Novel approaches for flexible aircraft simulation and control
- Applications of port-Hamiltonian systems in aerospace engineering
- Integration of machine learning with physical modeling

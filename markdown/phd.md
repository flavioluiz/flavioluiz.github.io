My PhD thesis is about modeling and control of a flexible-fluid coupled system.

At [ISAE](http://www.isae.fr), an experimental set up is available that consists of an aluminium plate with
a (water) tank near the tip. The idea is that this device has some similarity to an airplane wing with a tip tank. The structure and the fluid both moves at similar speeds, and their dynamics are coupled
as you can see in the following video:

So my thesis has two main goals: 1) find appropriate mathematical models for this experiment (modeling);
2) find appropriated methods to reduce the vibrations (control). For controlling the system, we are using
[piezoelectric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity) patches (which consists in a kind of material that
deforms when a voltage is applied).

Results of my research were presented in the following papers:

Since 2014, I've been working with port-Hamiltonian approach for modeling and control
of flexible-fluid structures.
A quick introduction about this subject is presented [here](port-hamiltonian.html).

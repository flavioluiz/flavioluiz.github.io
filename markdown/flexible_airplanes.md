# Aeroelasticity and Flight Dynamics of Flexible Aircraft

My research focuses on the modeling, simulation, and control of flexible aircraft, with particular emphasis on cases where structural deformations significantly influence flight characteristics. This interaction between structural dynamics and flight mechanics becomes crucial for modern aircraft design, especially for:
- High-aspect-ratio wings
- Lightweight structures
- High-altitude long-endurance (HALE) aircraft
- Novel aircraft configurations

## Research Context

The increasing demand for fuel efficiency has led to aircraft designs with higher aspect ratio wings and lighter structures. These design trends result in more pronounced aeroelastic effects that must be properly understood and accounted for during the design phase. A historical example of the challenges in this field is the [NASA Helios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Helios) aircraft, whose [crash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Helios#Crash) highlighted the importance of understanding coupled flight dynamics and aeroelastic effects.

## Current Research

As coordinator of the FINEP/EMBRAER project "Advanced Studies in Flight Physics and Control" (2022-Present), our research group investigates various aspects of flexible aircraft dynamics, including:
- Nonlinear aeroelastic modeling
- Flight dynamics simulation
- Control system design
- Load analysis and prediction
- System identification
- Reduced-order modeling
